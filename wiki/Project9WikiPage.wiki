  Impediments:

*_Sprint 1 Daily Standup (07/4/2012)_* ... No Class


*_Sprint 1 Daily Standup (07/9/2012)_*

  * *Arthur*
    Yesterday:
  -- I did a lot of research on how to create a timer in android and the best idea yet is to use the handler class and not java.util.timer because the java.util.timer library will create another thread, and we don't want that because we want as little processing as possible. Handlers allow things to be done within the same thread and then will interrupt the thread to do something else.

  -- I have the code for the beginning of a timer already implemented and tested.  I can set how many seconds I want the timer to run as well.
    Today:
  -- I will talk to my group about exactly what next step will be after the timer is done.  

  -- I will ask my group what's better, the timer showing (takes up room on the screen) or hiding the timer and have it just working in the background.
    Impediments:

  -- I haven't gotten the code to work on the emulator on my work laptop.  I only have it working on my home desktop.  I need it to work on my work laptop too so that I can show my group things without committing any changes to svn.
