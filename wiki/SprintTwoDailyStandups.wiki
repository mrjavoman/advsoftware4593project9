*_Sprint 2 Daily Standup #2 (07/16/2012)_*


  * *Lizeth:*

  Yesterday:

  -- Worked on the layout word_mark.xml

  Today:

  -- Commit the project with two layouts (word_mark_cell.xml & word_mark_tablet.xml) to the repository
  
  -- Figure out 'code' so when the device runs the app, it will know which layout to use

  Impediments:

  -- The layout worked differently in the screen of a tablet and a cellphone ... so I needed to do a different layout for each

  -- I added the instructional text to the timer pop up

  -- I added a sound to the timer when it goes off

  Today:

  -- I plan on exploring options for importing a new file into the database as a new story

  Impediments:

  -- I need to learn more about sql commands

 * *Arthur:*

Yesterday:

  -- I got the transformer device to work with the eclipse project.  Previously I was only working with an emulator, but now that the project is in landscape mode, the emulator won't cut it.

  Today:

  -- I plan on working on the ability to scroll the page that has the passage that the student is reading.  Possibly enabling scrolling with two fingers.
