  Today:

  -- Commit the project with two layouts (word_mark_cell.xml & word_mark_tablet.xml) to the repository

  Impediments:

Yesterday:

  -- I got the transformer device to work with the eclipse project.  Previously I was only working with an emulator, but now that the project is in landscape mode, the emulator won't cut it.

  Today:

* *Lauren:*
  
  Yesterday:

  -- I worked on getting the scrolling to work on the page that displays the actual story

  Today:

  -- I plan on continuing to try to get the scroll to work and also look at implementing the import function

  Impediments:

  -- The layout we used to wrap the buttons doesnt want to play well with the scroll view

 * *Arthur:*

Yesterday:

  -- I tried getting the scroll view to work with the app.  The app still isn't scrolling correctly though.  See impediments.

  Today:

  -- I will continue working on getting the ScrollView to work on the PredicateLayout or possibly starting from scratch all over and forgetting about the Predicate Layout.

  Impediments:

  -- The Predicate Layout Class is not combining well with the scrollview.
