  Impediments:

  -- The layout we used to wrap the buttons doesnt want to play well with the scroll view

 * *Arthur:*

  Yesterday:

  -- I tried getting the scroll view to work with the app.  The app still isn't scrolling correctly though.  See impediments.

  Today:

  -- I will continue working on getting the ScrollView to work on the PredicateLayout or possibly starting from scratch all over and forgetting about the Predicate Layout.
